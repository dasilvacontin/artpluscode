Thanks SO much for all the love youâ€™ve given my art and me these past months!  You motivate me to keep pushing, and harder ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’–. Hoping to create and design a lot more in 2018!! ðŸ˜Š

Fyi, the messages are taken mostly from the #art+#code posts, but thereâ€™s some DMs too. Sorry if I missed any of them! Specially the irl ones.

In regards to the animation, the messagesâ€™ speed and z-index depend on the messageâ€™s height (line count). They are also randomly distributed horizontally with a bigger weight towards the edges, because that way it looks less cluttered in the middle and it looks more like a conversation.

Hope you are all having a wonderful time â€“ talk soon! ðŸ˜Š
