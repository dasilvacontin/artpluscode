#art+#code #3: song slit-scan
.
Song: Mutemath - Vitals. (which I got to see live in London! 💙)
.
So happy I can finally show you the final result! I started working on this piece almost a month ago, but life has been very busy, being my last month in London 😢.
.
Initially, I wanted to produce an image where every row of pixels would represent the frequencies of a song at a given time. So looking at the big picture, you would see which frequencies and parts of the song are more intense.
.
However, I was not able to find out how to easily obtain the frequencies of a song at any point in time – it feels like it would be a bit complicated without these magic AudioNodes that JavaScript has (point me in the right direction if you know how!). And the AudioNodes (afaik) only give me samples and their frequencies in real time, as the song plays. So to generate the image I'd have to wait for the whole song to finish, which is not ideal. 😅
.
In the end, experimenting with what I could do, I ended up with this spectrum visualisation that gets persisted and pushed over time. It looks visually pleasing, but it doesn't give too much insight into the song – it's very hard to tell the "wave" or shape of the frequencies over time. Maybe if this were 3D I could rotate the piece and find a more interesting point of view. 🤔
.
Last, it was very interesting to have a UI to manipulate the visualization's parameters in real-time, which really help with exploring color combinations and silly things like tilting the spectrum. I'll definitively do it more often! 😊
.
I hope you enjoy this piece and its "bloopers". Let me know if there's any aspects, details, or shots, that you especially like – it would make my day! 😊❤️ Any questions about the piece or the process are welcome too, of course!
